Dear students,

If you are done with training, you can continue with models testing.

This is our last step (17.) of HTK tutorial - models evaluation.
You should  show me your grammar  before you start to record wavefiles.

Best Regards

Nino

17. Test of models

mkdir test; cd test

Write your test grammar to file wdnet.grm and compile it into HTK format: 

 HParse wdnet.grm wdnet.lat

Create phonetical dictionary dict.tst from your grammar words and generate test sentences:  

HSGen -n 20 wdnet.lat dict.tst > test_sentences.txt

Record 20 sentences to wav files in the same way as training sentences and create analogically with help of previous scripts following files: 
test_codestr.scp, test.scp, test_words.mlf.

Start your test recognition:

HVite -T 1 -C ../config1 -H ../hmm9/macros -H ../hmm9/hmmdefs -S test.scp -l '*' -i recout.mlf -w wdnet.lat -p 0.0 -s 5.0 dict.test ../monophones1 

Evaluate your recognition output file recout.mlf by

HResults -I test_words.mlf ../monophones1 recout.mlf

.
